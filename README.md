# Restaurant Menu Project

#### Use Case Scenario:
You may choose a category from the menu and add items to your shopping cart. Upon clicking 'checkout,' you will be able to view the total amount of your order.

#### Explanation:
This is a React Native project that is centered around developing a mobile application which is about restaurant menu and shopping system clone. It allows users to perform CRUD operations via REST API. The application's front-end has been customized and designed by myself, excluding the images and icons.

The key functionality of the application enables users to interact with a menu to select various categories. Once a category is chosen, users can add items from that category into their shopping cart. Upon selecting the 'checkout' option, the application displays the total amount of the user's orders.

This mobile application aims to provide a user-friendly experience for managing shopping activities, allowing users to easily browse through categories, add items to their cart, and review their order total before proceeding to checkout. The backend functionality is powered by the REST API, which handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, ensuring seamless communication between the front-end and the server.
